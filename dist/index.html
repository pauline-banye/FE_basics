        </p>
        <blockquote id="recommendation">
          <strong>
            “The fact that with our student body largely Southern in constitution a colored man should be elected to and be popular in such a position is in itself no mean recommendation.”

        </blockquote>

          From Crozer, King went on to Boston University, where he received a doctorate (1955) for a dissertation titled <strong>“A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.”</strong>
